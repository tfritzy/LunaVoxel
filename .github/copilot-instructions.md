## Code Comments

Almost never add comments to code. The bar is very high for a situation to merit a comment. It should only be when the logic is not intuitive and an explanation is needed.

## Screenshots

Always take and include screenshots of UI changes. Start a dev server, navigate to the relevant UI, and capture the result so the user can see the visual impact of the change.
